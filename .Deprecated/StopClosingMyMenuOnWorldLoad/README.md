# StopClosingMyMenuOnWorldLoad

Simple mod that prevents the menu from closing when a world is loaded.

This does not handle keeping the menu open when commiting an action that would normally close it, such as respawning via the menu. As of a recent ChilloutVR update, actions that are not initiated by the player will not close the menu, ie. death in combat or forced teleport/respawn, so this is not too much of a concern.

Nicked the old patch from MenuScalePatch [Kafeijao](https://github.com/kafeijao) made me and threw it into it's own mod. Still works.
