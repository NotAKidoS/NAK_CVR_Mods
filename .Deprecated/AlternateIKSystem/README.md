## AlternateIKSystem

This is a super fucked mix of DesktopVRIK, StateBehaviours, IKFixes, & IKTweaks with general structure inspired by ChilloutVRs existing IKSystem.

It is a personal project that I am unsure how far I will go with. Currently only Desktop VRIK works as that was easiest to implement.

This mod is partially built off of [IKTweaks - GPLv3](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/tree/master/IKTweaks):

(BodyHandling, MusclePoses)

With a mix of [DesktopVRIK](https://github.com/NotAKidoS/NAK_CVR_Mods/tree/main/DesktopVRIK):

(Desktop IK, VRIKHelpers, IKPose)

And a hint of [StateBehaviours](https://github.com/NotAKidoS/StateBehaviours/tree/main/Mod/StateBehaviours):

(BodyControl)

Then finally [IKFixes](https://github.com/NotAKidoS/NAK_CVR_Mods/tree/main/IKFixes):

(Solver Weight Helpers)
