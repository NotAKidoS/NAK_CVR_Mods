# ShadowCloneFallback

Simple mod that exposes a toggle for the Fallback Shadow Clone implementation.
By default, using this mod will enable the less-performant shadow clones. Only use this mod if you for whatever reason have issues with the compute shader clones.

Originally made the mod for debugging a potential crash a friend was experiencing, which turned out to be unrelated to the shader clones.
