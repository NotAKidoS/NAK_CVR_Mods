# MoreMenuOptions

Exposes some menu options:
- Main Menu Scale Modifier
- Main Menu Distance Modifier
- Quick Menu World Anchor in VR

By default, the menu is adjusted to a more comfortable scale for VR only, but can be configured in the mod settings.

The mod is very slapped together and messy lol.
