# SmootherRay

Smoothes your controller while the raycast lines are visible.
This is a CVR adaptation of a Beat Saber mod: [BeatSaber_SmoothedController](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_SmoothedController)

- An option is provided to only smooth when aiming at menus.
- Smoothing characteristics are completely configurable, but the defaults are basically perfect.
- Pairs well with the [WhereAmIPointing](https://github.com/NotAKidoS/NAK_CVR_Mods/tree/main/WhereAmIPointing) mod.

**Only supports OpenVR, not OpenXR.**

-# NOTE: This disables the shitty built-in Smooth Ray setting when the mod is enabled. Compare both & you'll see why.
