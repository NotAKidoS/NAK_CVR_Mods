  "description": "Stickers! Allows you to place small images on any surface. Requires both users to have the mod installed. Synced over Mod Network.\n\nLimitations:\n- Image should be under 256KB in size.\n- Image dimensions should be a power of 2 (e.g. 512x512, 1024x1024).\n  - If the image exceeds the size limit or is not a power of 2 the mod will automatically resize it.\n  - The automatic resizing may result in loss of quality (or may just fail), so it is recommended to resize the image yourself before placing it in the `UserData/Stickers/` folder.\n\n-# More information can be found on the [README](https://github.com/NotAKidoS/NAK_CVR_Mods/blob/main/Stickers/README.md).",
