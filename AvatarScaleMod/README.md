# AvatarScaleMod
 
Proof of concept mod to add Avatar Scaling to any avatar. This is local-only, but I may toy with using Mod Network.

Legit threw this together in three hours. ChilloutVR handles all the hard stuff already with its existing animation-clip-based Avatar Scaling.

## Notes:
* Constraint scaling partially conflicts with avatars run through my [Avatar Scale Tool](https://github.com/NotAKidoS/AvatarScaleTool).
* This is local-only, at least unless I bother with Mod Network.
* The entire thing is pretty messy and I am unsure of the performance impact, especially with scaling all lights, audio, & constraints.
