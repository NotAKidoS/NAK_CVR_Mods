# Share Bubbles

Share Bubbles! Allows you to drop down bubbles containing Avatars & Props. Requires both users to have the mod installed. Synced over Mod Network.

### How to use
Open a Content Details page and click the Share button. You can choose between placing a Share Bubble or Sharing directly with users in the same instance. When placing a Share Bubble, you will be prompted to configure the bubble. Once you're ready, you can then Drop or Select the bubble for placement.

While viewing content details of an item shared *to you* by another player, you can also click **Unshare** to revoke access to the content.

#### Visibility
- **Everyone** - All players with the mod installed can see the bubble.
- **Friends Only** - Only friends with the mod installed can see the bubble.

#### Lifetime
- **2 Minutes** - The bubble will disappear after 2 minutes.
- **Session** - The bubble will only disappear once you delete it with Delete mode or leave the instance.

#### Access Control
- **Keep Access** - Users who claim the bubble get to keep the shared content.
- **Session Access** - Users who claim the bubble only get to keep the shared content for however long they are in the instance with you.
- **No Access** - Users will not be able to claim the contents of the bubble and will only be able to view it.

Access Control is only available for **Private Content** and serves as a way to share content in-game.

**Note:** Session Access requires the game to be running to revoke access once you or the claimant leaves the instance. If the game is closed unexpectedly, the claimant will keep the content until you next launch the game and connect to an online instance.
