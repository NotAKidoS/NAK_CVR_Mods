# How To Install

The majority of modifications found in this repository are reviewed and made available through the [ChilloutVR Modding Group](https://discord.gg/dndGPM3bxu). 

To access the approved versions, you can either navigate to the `#mod-releases` channel in the ChilloutVR Modding Group Discord or utilize the [ChilloutVR Melon Assistant](https://github.com/knah/CVRMelonAssistant) to install them automatically.

If preferred, you may also download the most recent version directly from the **Releases** section. However, please keep in mind that not all of my mod binaries are presently hosted on this repository and may only be found on their separate repositories. 

It is important to exercise caution when using anything outside of the ChilloutVR Modding Group releases, as it may not have undergone review and could be harmful or non-functional.
