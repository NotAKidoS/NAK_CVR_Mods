Almost all base game features & systems that differ when in VR are now updated after switch. There are still very likely small quirks that need ironing out still, but everything major is now fixed and accounted for. 

## There are two versions of this mod!
**DesktopVRSwitch** is built for the Stable branch of ChilloutVR. (OpenVR)

**DesktopXRSwitch** is built for the Experimental branch of ChilloutVR (OpenXR)

Once the Experimental branch of ChilloutVR hits Stable, the mod name will be changing from VR -> XR.
