# PickupPushPull
Allows you to push & pull props with Gamepad and VR.

Simply maps Gamepad & VR joystick input to objectPushPull.

Hold left bumper on Gamepad to use objectPushPull.

You can also rotate props while holding down the selected bind in VR, or right bumper on Gamepad.

Desktop can use the zoom bind while holding props without pickup origin to rotate with mouse.

As you can tell, i have no fucking clue how to use GitHub.
