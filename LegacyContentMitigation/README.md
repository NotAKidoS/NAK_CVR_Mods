# LegacyContentMitigation

Experimental mod that manually renders both VR eyes separately while in Legacy Worlds.

The mod will automatically kick-in when loading NonSpi Worlds & prevent Shader Replacement for all content while active. You can also manually toggle it within the BTKUI Misc tab for experimenting.

-# There is an obvious performance penalty with rendering the world 2x & toggling the head hiding per eye, so enabling the mod outside of Legacy Worlds is not recommended.
