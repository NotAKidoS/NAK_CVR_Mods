# PlapPlapForAll

Penetrator SFX mod which adds Noach's PlapPlap prefab to any detected DPS setup on avatars that do not already have it.

**Requirements:**
- The avatar must have DPS lights
- The avatar must not already have Noach's PlapPlap prefab
- The avatar must be tagged Suggestive or Explicit
- Mature content must be enabled in the user's settings
- The avatar must be worn by a friend or the local user

SFX are driven by the Avatar Audio slider. 

If you have a setup which does not function correctly with this mod, I can *try* to look into it, but no guarantees.
